        <h2>History</h2>
        <div class="history-container">
          <p>
White water Rafting was founded in 2018 by Mengi with a single raft, a big dream, and a deep passion for outdoor adventure. It all began on a quiet riverbank, where Mengi was inspired by the beauty and excitement of nature. What started as weekend rafting trips with friends soon turned into a growing business. Mengi realized that people were searching for more than just an activity they were looking for connection, thrill, and a break from everyday routines. With that vision, White Water Rafting was born.

In the early days, everything was done by hand, from repairing rafts to scouting new river routes. Through dedication, hard work, and a love for the outdoors, the company began to attract more adventurers. Word spread quickly, and what began as a simple idea evolved into a trusted name in white water rafting. Today, White Water Rafting is known for its friendly guides.
